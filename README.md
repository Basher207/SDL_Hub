# SDL_Hub

Just testing SDL (On mac)

Download the mac framework from:

https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

The make file uses -framwork, which searches in your framework folders (Static link)
So follow instructions in the download and put it in your framwork folder:

/Library/Frameworks
or
~/Library/Frameworks
